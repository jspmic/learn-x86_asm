# Chapter 4: All About Functions
---
We use functions to break the program into pieces.
The data items the function is given to process are called `parameters`.
The function's interface are its parameters list and its processing expectations.
In assembly language, the primitive functions are similar to system calls, although
those syscalls aren't "really" functions.
