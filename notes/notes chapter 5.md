# Dealing with files
Data which is stored in files is called persistent data,
because it persists in files that remain on the disk even when the program isnâ€™t running(except temporary files).

## The UNIX File Concept
The UNIX method of dealing with files is far the simplest one. The UNIX files can be accessed as a sequential stream
of bytes. Here's the process of dealing with files:

1. You open a file by giving its name
2. The OS gives you a number, called a `file descriptor`(fd), which is used to refer to the file
3. Write/read to/into the file using the `file descriptor`
4. Close the file which makes the fd useless

We will deal with files in this way when writing our asm programs:
1. Tell Linux the name of the file to open and in what mode you want it(read, write, read&write, ...).
We will use the `open` syscall which takes a `filename`, a number representing the `mode`, and a `permission`
`%eax` will hold the `syscall` number which is `5`, the address of the first character of the `filename` into `%ebx`,
The `mode` number into `%ecx`, the permission set as a number into `%edx`.
> Tip: use 0666(with the leading zero) for the permissions if you're unfamiliar with them

2. the OS will return the `fd` in `%eax`

3. Operate on the file using the `fd`. For read use `read`(syscall number `3`); for write use `write`(syscall number `4`).
To call `read`, you need to have the fd in `%ebx`, the address for the buffer(to store what's read) in `%edx`(explained later).
`read` will return the number of characters read or an error code(usually negative). The same goes with `write` except that
the buffer should be filled with the data to write(not empty like `read`).

4. Close the file using `close`(syscall number `6`), with the `fd` in `%ebx`.

## Buffers and .bss
A buffer is a continuous block of bytes used for bulk data transfer.
When you request to read a file, the OS needs to have a place to store the data it reads.
That place is called a buffer. Usually, buffers are used temporarily to store data(it is read and stored into a permanent form).

> Note: Buffers are a fixed size, set by the programmer.
